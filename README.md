# SteathUSBRootkit
SteathUSBRootkit is a big project im working on, it is a USB connection deployed rootkit/virus that will implement a hidden file system,
hiding registry keys and files, hiding network connections and encryption of data flow, hiding all running processes and persistence that 
would not be detected by the basic operating system.
i would also like to focus more on anti-debugging, ant-forensics and obfuscation techniques to simulate a better virus and i would like
to impelment a menu that you could use as an attacker remotely (DNS resolving of attacker address with known domain, classic menu for sending
operations like dynamic file/network connection/process hiding, custom remote desktop control, bitcoin mining / other processing power
manipulation like resolving hashes, command execution of single-line commands or scripts in many different languages, file transfer and execution and more)
